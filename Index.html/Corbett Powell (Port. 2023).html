        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings, my name is Corbett Powell, and I currently hold the position of Retail Store Keyholder at Delta-9 Biotech.
            I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. My journey in academia led me to Herzings College, where I plan to earn my diploma in 
            Software Development in 2024. That experience solidified my passion for computer science, which remains a significant part of my expertise today.
            In terms of my professional aspirations, I'm committed to continuous growth and exploration. 
            Over the next few years, I aim to master new technologies in the realm of computer science, achieve advanced certifications, and continue my professional development.
            When I'm not diving into the intricacies of computer science, you'll find me immersed in a range of interests.
            Whether it's playing video games, collecting Magic: The Gathering cards, or delving into the depths of theoretical physics and biology, my curiosity knows no bounds.
            If you're interested in connecting, collaborating, or simply having a chat, don't hesitate to contact me via email.
